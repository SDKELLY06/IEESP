    "The dataset in which we have chosen is a luxury watch pricing dataset. The criteria in which this dataset contains includes brands, models, prices, cases, straps, movements, water resistance, case diameter, case thickness, band width, dial color, crystal material, complications and power reserves. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset has 14 columns and 508 rows. It is a publicly available dataset available on Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is useful for Businesses, Resellers, enthusiasts and individuals wishing to further expand their knowledge in the expertise\n",

    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The Objective of this project is to **evaluate and provide statistics on the pricing of these watches compared to the prestige of their branding and the condition they are in**. We believe that these categories are important to compare as branding significantly influences the perceived value and resale potential of a luxury watch, aswell as the condition greatly affecting the collectability aswell as longevity of the singular watch itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI System\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to demo the AI user system by asking the user to input **Brand, User Lifestyle and Price**. With the information given, the system will take the information from the dataset and inform the user whether the watch seems like a good option for the price quoted **compared to the user's lifestyle, aswell as how reliable the watch should be**.
